This is an alpha version of the code.
The code works with ppm images only.

The package contains the following files:

  README       - this file
  segm_main.cc - input/output operations
  segm.cc      - the segmenter
  segm.hh      - the header file

To compile use:
  g++ -O2 -o segm segm.cc segm_main.cc -lm

I tested the code on:
  IRIX Release 5.3 IP22 (Silicon Graphics)
  SunOS 5.5 Generic sun4u
  Digital UNIX V4.0 (Rev. 386)

In addition, the code can be compiled with the CC compiler on 
  SunOS 5.5 Generic sun4u
using:
  CC  -O2 -o segm segm.cc segm_main.cc -lm

Usage: 
  segm image_name.ppm

This version of the code offers three segmentation classes, called
  Undersegmentation - lowest resolution       (u)
  Oversegmentation  - intermediate resolution (o)
  Quantization      - highest resolution      (q)

In addition, the program detects the most important color inside 
one or more given windows (w).

The output consists of 2 images: 
  result.ppm - the segmented version of the input image;
  result.pgm - the associated contour image.

The output is displayed using the xv.
